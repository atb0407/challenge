# Caching Fetch Library
Implemented a caching mechanism for fetch requests to reduce redundant network calls and improve performance.

# Improvement Opportunities

To ensure this code is production-ready, I would consider implementing the following improvements:

## 1. Add Unit Tests
- Write comprehensive unit tests for components and utility functions.
- Use a testing framework like Jest and React Testing Library.
- Ensure high code coverage.

## 2. Docker Configurations
- Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
- Ensure the Docker images are optimized and secure.

## 3. Continuous Integration (CI)
- Set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Automate the running of tests and linting on each commit.

## 4. Code Linting and Formatting
- Integrate a linter like ESLint to maintain code quality.
- Use a code formatter like Prettier for consistent code style.

## 5. Folder Restructuring
- Organize folder structure to be more maintainable in the future.
